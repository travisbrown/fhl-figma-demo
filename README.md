## Figma sticker plugin demo

Some parts borrowed from [this demo](https://github.com/jackiecorn/figma-plugin-drag-and-drop).
In general don't expect anything here to reflect best or even decent practices. I have no idea what I'm doing.

To try it:

```
yarn install
yarn watch
```

And then open the `manifest.json` file in Figma via `Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest`.
